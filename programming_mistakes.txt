stupid mistakes:
- don't forget to reconsult after changes
- not size(), not sizeof(), not len(), but length()
- not append(List, A, New) but append(List, [A], New)
- 

key predicates:
- sort(A, SortedA)
- reverse(A, reversedA)

singleton variables:
- to state facts about fixed variables, don't use variable notation,
use inverted commas. eg 
andgate('And'). rather than andgate(And).


insufficient memory:
- with recursive functions, always make recursive call asap
